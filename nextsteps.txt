*** NEXT STEPS ***

This project currently is a react scaffolding for the end-goal parent portal website. The functionality we have now that is desired:
- forum based homepage
- ability to ask questions
- AI integration to give quick response
- respond to other questions on homepage
- post question to forum for others to see / respond to


Features to ADD:
- user authentication (AWS Cognito)
- profile creation / editing

Plan:
- Remove unnecessary files for services we aren't using (gemini, firebase, etc) - DONE
- Create custom domain for web app (squarespace) - DONE (collegeask.org)
- Implement OpenAI services for AI functionality - DONE

- Implement AWS SDK into project (typescript) 
- In AWS Cognito portal, setup ACM certificate to be used for project using custom domain
- User pool, app client, and google federated IP already setup
- Setup facebook federated IP
- Integrate AWS Cognito into project (use HostedUI login page)
- Use JWTs to check if user is logged in, and preserve logged in state

AFTER Testing and Verifying Cognito is FULLY functional...
... if user does not have account, use lambda to automatically create account in dynamoDB users table (already created table)
... redirect to create profile page, use lambda functions to update profile
... otherwise if user does have account setup, redirect to homepage

Important Factors:
- We want to execute each part of the plan step-by-step, outlining everything that needs to be done and where it needs to be setup from.
- Before any code is written, we want to ensure the previous step is setup correctly and the necessary info is present.
- When writing code, go FILE by FILE. We want to write one file at a time, build the project, ensure we have no errors, then move onto the next file.
- Ensure comprehensive comments / documentation is written throughout each file, along with console logging for debugging purposes.
- Before moving onto a next step / file, ensure all necessary testing is complete and the project builds correctly. DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT VERIFYING FUNCTIONALITY

- Keep module imports / exports standard across the entire file. USE THE SAME MODULE IMPORT / EXPORT FORMAT ACROSS THE APP.
